31/5
	* Created execution layer for staging_data.py in main.py
	* Restructured DatabaseControl. Cursors are now re-initialised in each instance and method
1/6
	* Created db transaction in stage_shots() to group shot insert and time update insert, using context manager.
        - Simply just a commit() and rollback()
	* Restructured DatabaseControl again with a class method that returns connection object and another class method that sets class variable 'db_name'
		- Now the child class will recreate a connection each time the instance method is called
        - Changed how each instance method creates connections and cursors (context manager)
	* Added global function staging_data.get_updates() to retrieve latest updates from teams.
    * Added .gitignore file
    * Updated all shots in stg_shots with:
        - Stacks: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    * Created global function staging_data.stg_one to run one team/segment at a time

5/6
    * Mapped out which fields from stg_shots go into dim and fact columns into 'column_mapping.md'

8/6
    * Testing INSERT queries from staging to star schema.
    * Found issue where i was inserting duplicate games in dim_game


11/6
    * Altered structure of star schema and staging table to include shot_id, time_id


12/6
    * Deleted old database
    * Added '_get_ids' to player_shots() to retrieve shot_id and time_id
    * Ran 'reference_data()' to populate reference tables (teams & players)

13/6
    * Solved the issue of duplicate entries!!
        - I was joining all dim tables on game id's only but since each game id has TWO matchup values ie. 'NYK vs GSW' & 'GSW @ NYK'
            i needed to also add 'AND st.matchup = g.matchup'. Otherwise shots were being added to each (DISTINCT matchup-id value)
    * Added htm and vtm to dim_games
    * Added 'update players' logic to SQL to update players that may change teams


1/7
    * Created load_procedures.sql to hold all stored procedures to move data from staging to star schema
    * Created orchestrate_load.py to orchestrate running of stored procedures


2/7
    * Changed 'matchup' string for teams to have one consistent perspective for both teams as 
      this was causing shots to not be inserted in fact_shots due to double up. One id for two matchup strings
      eg. 'BOS @ ATL' --- 'ATL vs BOS'
    * Changed the dim_games JOIN ON to game_id only, removed matchup

3/7
    * Found that duplicate time_id's can be accidentally generated (rare occasions, 10 in 200k+).
      Simply added game_event_id again to the end of the id to make the id unique 100% of the time



Further features to be added:
- Daily match scan: Scan for finished daily games and retrieve those shots automatically
- Add game_log API call ability to search game that a player has played in
- Add season select ability (2024-25, 2025-26 etc.)
- Create functionality to add last_n_games
- Include other metrics and API calls to give more context to shots
