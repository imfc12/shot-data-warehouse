31/5
	* Created execution layer for staging_data.py in main.py
	* Restructured DatabaseControl. Cursors are now re-initialised in each instance and method
1/6
	* Created db transaction in stage_shots() to group shot insert and time update insert, using context manager.
        - Simply just a commit() and rollback()
	* Restructured DatabaseControl again with a class method that returns connection object and another class method that sets class variable 'db_name'
		- Now the child class will recreate a connection each time the instance method is called
        - Changed how each instance method creates connections and cursors (context manager)
	* Added global function staging_data.get_updates() to retrieve latest updates from teams.
    * Added .gitignore file
    * Updated all shots in stg_shots with:
        - Stacks: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    * Created global function staging_data.stg_one to run one team/segment at a time

5/6
    * Mapped out which fields from stg_shots go into dim and fact columns into 'column_mapping.md'

8/6
    * Testing INSERT queries from staging to star schema.
    * Found issue where i was inserting duplicate games in dim_game



TO DO:
Solve issue where of inserting duplicate games in dim_game
- Where to remove distinct from? Where to have DISTINCT?


Stored procedure to load data from stg to fact/dim
* Run process of stg_shots -> facts/dimensions tables
* Surrogate key of the fact table?

LONG TERM:
- Create ability to search one team at a time
    - Scan for finished games and look those teams up
- Add game log ability to search the game that the player has played in
